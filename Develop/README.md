# ExpressServerBackendHookUp
Here is the link to my deployed heroku application https://notetakerapplication134.herokuapp.com/.

This is a server side note taking application. This application uses node.js, express and nodes inegrated file system. I first wrote the code that sets up the express server and connects it to the local host. I second wrote my html server connections that linked the html pages, the css, and the index js. Third I wrote my application server side code that runs the note taker. The note taker saves the notes to a json file. Allows you to delete the notes by id. Finally will reload the notes to the note taker when you restart the server. My heroku application has been successfully deployed.
